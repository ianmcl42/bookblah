                                    <h2>True Grit by Charles Portis</h2>

                                         </p><p>Interesting tone and language - the direct first person narration and clarity appealed.
                                         </p><p>Not a genre many were drawn too, interesting but probably wouldn't pursue the author.
                                         </p><p>Hard to assess the book after having seen one of the movie versions - John Wayne's voice and portrayal of Rooster larger than life.
                                         </p><p>The reality of the people - Judge Parker a true character.
                                         </p><p>The Presbyterian influence on the development of the "west".
                                         </p><p>Reference to the Civil War, the structure of the system of law - U.S. Marshalls and Texas Rangers - all interesting.</p><br>

                                         </p><p>There was ring of reality to the traits of the characters. It works better when you consider all characters are flawed.
                                         </p><p>Like watching strain wreck in slow motion. She was like a petulant child.
                                        </p><p> Created some anger and emotion.
                                         </p><p>Brought up issues but didn't really tackle any of them.

                                        <p>Mike and Psmith - P.G. Wodehouse (Why wasn't I given this to read when I was a teenager! The "P" is silent.) So good it needs a quote...</p><br>
                                            <p id="quote">There are situations in life which are beyond one. The sensible man realises this, and slides out of such situations, admitting himself beaten. Others try to grapple with them, but it never does any good. When affairs get into a real tangle, it is best to sit still and let them straighten themselves out. Or, if one does not do that, simply to think no more about them. This is Philosophy. The true philosopher is the man who says "All right," and goes to sleep in his arm-chair. One' s attitude towards Life' s Little Difficulties should be that of the gentleman in the fable, who sat down on an acorn one day, and happened to doze. The warmth of his body caused the acorn to germinate, and it grew so rapidly that, when he awoke, he found himself sitting in the fork of an oak, sixty feet from the ground. He thought he would go home, but, finding this impossible, he altered his plans. "Well, well," he said, "if I cannot compel circumstances to my will, I can at least adapt my will to circumstances. I decide to remain here." Which he did, and had a not unpleasant time. The oak lacked some of the comforts of home, but the air was splendid and the view excellent.</p><br>

                                <h3>Ideas...</h3><br>
                                <p>3 A.M. - Nick Pirog
                                <p> The Forgotten Rebels of Eureka - Clare Wright
                                <p> Jonathon Strange & Mr Norelle - Suzanna Clarke </p><br>

                                <p> Next time, 29th June, we will discuss Annihilation by Jeff Vandermeer.</p><br>

                    <h2>Annihilation by Jeff Vandermeer.</h2>
                            <p>As recommended by Robin Sloan, author of Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore this looks a whacky ride.</p><br>

                        <p>Annihilation, by Jeff Vandermeer, is the first book of the Southern Reach Trilogy so we will see if it inspires further exploration of Area X - an area area cut off from civilisation. The book begins with the thirteenth expedition setting off to gather more information about this strange place.</p><br>

                        <p>We shall see!</p><br>

                        <p>Mixed feelings from the assembly. Hated, not finished, annoying, not believable, didn't mind, straighton to the next book, oh no - the third book isn't released yet, have to wait another sixty days! A grief story exploring the loss of a partner - challenged by the reading style.
                        </p><br>

                            <p>It's animal time once again - this time in Vermont.</p>

                        <p>This one, by Nick Trout, came up as a Deal of the Day offer on our Kindle and looked a bit of fun. </p>

                        <p>Nice read, easy, liked dogs - and they all lived happily ever after! Did he give the twenty bucks back?</p>
                        <p>Too wordy, no setting, more like a monologue than a story - too much background information.</p>
                        <p>A little window into the pet world for non-petties.</p>
                        <p>We wanted to yell at him - get over yourself - too much psycho babble!</p>
                        <p>Happened too quick - only takes a week to solve life's crises - a bit "Briny Cafe" in its cliched style.</p>

                        <p>24th on the all time list!</p><br>

                        <p>- Needs a good edit.</p>
                        <p>- Main character needed a good shake up.
                        <p>- Good ending.</p></p>
                        <p>- Confusing sequence.</p><br>
